# Spm-Time-Limiter-v1.10

a minecraft plugin that limits player game time, spm counter 2021 is also provided in it

# How-To-Use
- download the jar from here  https://drive.google.com/file/d/18tsAkgHv51vuLAy2gJb9mwmgp7JgIcb8/view?usp=sharing.
- move it to ur minecraft server plugin directory
- launch the server and plugin will automatically load
# Caution
- if you decided to close down the server, please tell the players to leave first before shutting down (this will make sure their data is saved offline)
- if you got banned and you want to unbanned yourself, first tell players to quit and shutdown the server, go to server directory/plugins then u will see a folder called spm-time-limiter. Click on it and you will see a file called custom.yml delete the data based on the index of the player u want to unban. AND ALSO REMEMBER TO CHANGE the  other number of index of users (example playerQuitGameTime0:<--- if this is the one you removed, all the numbers need to deduct by one)! Last but not least update the numbers of quitted based on the number of players u have on the custom.yml do not change the date. IF ALL GOES WRONG and you have no idea on what im saying, head to custom.yml removed everything and paste this (numbers of quitted: 0) and save. Then everything is reset to default.
